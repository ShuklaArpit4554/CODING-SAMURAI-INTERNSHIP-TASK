// User Guide:

// 1) Program Start: Run the program, and it will prompt you
// to enter the number of students whose grades you want to calculate.

// 2) Input Details: For each student, you will enter their name and ID.
// You will input their scores for assignments, quizzes, and exams. Ensure
// the scores are between 0 and 100.
// You will then enter the weightage for each category. For example,
// if assignments are 30% of the grade, enter 0.3.

// 3) Calculation: The program calculates the final grade using a 
// weighted average formula.
// It converts the numerical grade into a letter grade based on 
// standard grading scales.

// 4) Results Display: The program will display the studentâ€™s name, ID, 
// final grade, letter grade, and additional comments or feedback based on 
// their performance.

// 5) Multiple Students: The program will repeat the process for each student 
// until all students' grades have been entered and calculated.
